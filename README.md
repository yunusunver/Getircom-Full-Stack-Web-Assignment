# Full-Stack Web Assignment

THE CHALLENGE
In this full-stack web development assignment we would like you to create a simple to-do web
app. There is no need for a login / register system. Any user who has access to link can perform
any operation. There will only be one to-do list.
Some frameworks and languages are optional but in getir we use React, Redux, Express, Node
and Mongo. It is better if you complete the assignment with these technologies.

## REQUIREMENTS
1. Users must be able to add a new task to their to-do list.
2. Users must be able to list their tasks in the list.
3. Tasks should have at least two statuses like incomplete / completed.
4. Users must be able to change the status of the tasks.
5. Completed tasks should look different than the incomplete tasks.
6. Front-end web framework must be React.js. We believe that anyone familiar with a
component-based framework can complete this task in React also.
7. Even if we believe that this task can be completed without Redux, you will be using it if
you join our team so you should add Redux to your project.
8. Backend must be written in Node.js. We recommend using express.js for web framework.
9. Database must be mongodb. You are free to use javascript helper libraries to use
mongodb like mongoose. You can get a free online database from mlab or mongodb
atlas.
10. Project should be deployed. You are free to use any server. We recommend heroku since
it is easy and free.

## DELIVERABLES
- Github or any other cloud repository storage link to source code

- URL to access to project. However, if you have difficulties deploying the app you can
provide
○ Source code & running instructions

## WORTH HIGHLIGHTING
- We expect the simplest version to satisfy required tasks should be completed in a day.
However, it is not a speed test. Take your time! In fact, this task is open to furthermore
improvements and we expect you to add features on your own. If these new features will
cost you more time, feel free to have it. Ex: Adding a deadline to task, showing how much
time you have left to complete the task on the list etc.
- A well readable code is always appreciated.
- Do not forget that the purpose of this task is to see how do you complete a task on your
own and how do you write code in the languages that getir uses. However, this is not a
programming competition so do not spend too much time on small details. A working
project is the most valuable deliverable.
- Second most valuable point is to prove that you are aware of web programming best
practices regardless of the language or framework. We recommend that you do not go
over-engineering but show us your talent with some small details.
- The styling of the web app is not the most important criterion we will check. However,
anything that improves the UX (rather than UI) will be a bonus point on your name. Ex:
Responsive design, coloring, aligning items, modals, confirmation boxes, switches etc.
- Your feedback on how much actual time you needed to deliver the task will be helpful but
will not be used for the evaluation.
- You are free to use any extra libraries to deliver the needed functionality.
